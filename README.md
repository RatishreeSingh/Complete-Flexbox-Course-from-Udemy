# Complete-Flexbox-Course-from-Udemy

This is one of the courses available on Udemy called 'Complete Flexbox Course: Master CSS3 Flexbox for Good' by Peter Sommerhoff.

Although the course is approximately 4 years old and needs some updation, it has helped me clearly understand Flexbox.

In this repository I have stored some of the simple layouts taught in the course.
